# GravityDev3
Third iteration of a 2D gravity simulator. Features include clicking on a planet to lock onto it, center a focussed
    planet, and pan/zoom. Next version planned will be written in C++ for better
    acuracy and memory management, as this one has floating point imprecision
    issues, and Processing is not effecient with memory.
